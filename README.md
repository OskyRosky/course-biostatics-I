# Biostatistics

Foundations and Applications in Health Sciences

This repository contains the academic material for the Biostatistics course, designed for graduate students in Health Sciences and Health Services Management. The course focuses on the understanding and practical application of statistical methods, emphasizing their relevance in healthcare, research, and decision-making processes.

Biostatistics is presented not only as a theoretical discipline, but as a practical tool for analyzing, interpreting, and communicating quantitative and qualitative health data in professional contexts.

## 1. Course Overview

The Biostatistics course introduces students to the fundamental concepts and techniques of statistics, with a strong emphasis on applications in the health sector. The course covers descriptive statistics, probability theory, inferential statistics, and applied data analysis using computational tools.

Special attention is given to the interpretation of results and the use of statistics as a support tool for management, research, and evidence-based decision-making in healthcare environments.

## 4. Tools and Software Used

The course emphasizes practical application through the use of computational tools, primarily:

•	Microsoft Excel for:

•	Descriptive statistics.

•	Measures of position and variability.

•	Dynamic tables and charts.

•	Data visualization.

•	Dashboard creation.

•	SPSS for applied statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

These tools are used to bridge theoretical concepts with real data analysis scenarios commonly encountered in healthcare and administrative environments.

## 5. Teaching Methodology and Evaluation

Teaching Methodology

The course follows a mixed methodology combining theory and practice:

•	Conceptual lectures to introduce statistical principles.

•	Guided practical sessions focused on applied exercises.

•	Hands-on analysis using Excel and SPSS.

•	Interactive discussions to reinforce interpretation and critical thinking.

Student participation is encouraged throughout the course to promote collaborative learning and deeper understanding.

Evaluation Structure

Student performance is assessed through:

•	Guided practical assignments.
  
•	Applied statistical exercises.
  
•	Written examinations.
  
•	Excel-based dashboards.
  
•	Practical evaluation using SPSS.

The evaluation scheme ensures both conceptual understanding and applied competence.

## 6. Learning Outcomes and Professional Relevance

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

•	Understand and interpret statistical information in health-related contexts.

•	Apply descriptive and inferential statistical methods to real datasets.

•	Use statistical software to analyze, visualize, and communicate results.

•	Support managerial and clinical decisions using data-driven evidence.

•	Critically evaluate statistical findings in research and professional reports.
